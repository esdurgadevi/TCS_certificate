I participated in TCS CodeVita and successfully cleared the first round, receiving a certification for my achievement.

- Solved a scenario-based problem that required applying a sorting technique.
- Used Bubble Sort to efficiently solve the problem, even though sorting was not explicitly mentioned in the question.
- Improved my problem-solving skills by analyzing the given scenario and identifying the optimal approach.
- This experience enhanced my ability to apply algorithms in real-world situations and strengthened my logical thinking.
